									Uh, look me up when you get there. You're gonna be in the car with her. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? What?
								</p>

								<p>Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah, sure, okay. Bet your ass it works.</p>

								<p>So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Whoa, wait, Doc. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?</p>
